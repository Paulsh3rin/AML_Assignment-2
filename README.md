# AML_Assignment-2

This repository contains various machine learning models and their implementations for the Advanced Machine Learning (AML) assignment. The models included are BERT, CNN, LSTM, and a Voting Classifier.

### Directory Structure

- **Models**: Contains the saved models in `.h5` and `.pkl` formats.
- **data**: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the models.
- **BERT_model.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook for the BERT model implementation.
- **CNN_model.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook for the CNN model implementation.
- **LSTM.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook for the LSTM model implementation.
- **Voting_classifier_model.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook for the Voting Classifier model implementation.
- **cnn_model.h5**: Saved CNN model in H5 format.
- **cnn_model.pkl**: Saved CNN model in PKL format.
- **lstm_model.h5**: Saved LSTM model in H5 format.
- **lstm_model.pkl**: Saved LSTM model in PKL format.

### Models

1. **BERT Model**: Implementation of the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model for natural language processing tasks.
2. **CNN Model**: Implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification tasks.
3. **LSTM Model**: Implementation of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for sequential data tasks.
4. **Voting Classifier Model**: Implementation of a Voting Classifier that combines the predictions from multiple models to improve accuracy.

### Installation and Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AML_Assignment-2.git
   cd AML_Assignment-2
   ```

2. **Install the required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebooks**:
   ```bash
